# AutoSDV Development Commands
# Use `just --list` to see all available commands

# ============================================================================
# Modules -- grouped commands. `just <module>` lists that module's recipes.
#
# Invoke either way:  `just bag play`  or  `just bag::play`
#
# Only families entered deliberately live here. The daily verbs (build, test,
# clean, launch, checkout, setup) stay at the root -- partly by choice, and
# partly because a module may NOT share a name with a recipe: `mod launch`
# beside a `launch:` recipe is a hard error that kills the whole justfile.
# ============================================================================

# Demo scenarios: `just demo run` runs the COSS NDT replay end to end

# Rosbag recording, playback and download
mod bag 'just/bag.just'
# Control system testing: trajectories and the basic control launch
mod control 'just/control.just'

setup-autoware-data:

# Compile the TensorRT engines this stack needs, ahead of the first launch.
#
# Autoware compiles an .onnx into a .engine inside the NODE'S CONSTRUCTOR the
# first time it runs. On the Orin that is minutes per model, during which the
# node is not up and perception is unavailable. Doing it here turns that into a
# provisioning step.
#
# Engines are specific to the TensorRT version AND the GPU, so this must run ON
# THE TARGET BOARD. It cannot be baked into an image built elsewhere, and it
# must be re-run after an Autoware or JetPack upgrade.
#
# The model set below is what the perception presets actually resolve to:
# centerpoint_tiny (the perception stack resolves the centerpoint model to its
# tiny variant at runtime -- verified from a live launch's TRT input filenames,
# not from the launch arg defaults), the yolox-sPlus camera 2D detector, and
# the three traffic-light models that camera_lidar_fusion adds. Re-derive it if
# a preset changes:
#
#     play_launch resolve autosdv_launch autosdv.launch.yaml \
#       launch_perception:=true perception_preset:=camera_lidar_fusion -o ./tmp/m.yaml
#
# `autoware_shape_estimation` is deliberately absent: it uses TensorRT but ships
# no `build_only` argument, so its pointnet engine is still built on first use.
# That is one model rather than five, and it succeeds now that the directory is
# writable.

# Populate the engine cache from a NEWSLabNTU/AutoSDV release, if this board's
# fingerprint has a match there, then build-engines -- which is the correct
# verify step for free: `build_only:=true` already loads a matching .engine in
# seconds instead of rebuilding it, so a good download is confirmed by how fast
# this finishes, and a bad or missing one just falls through to a real build.
# This is what the tensorrt-engines setup step runs; `just build-engines`
# alone always skips the cache. See docs/roadmap/11-engine-file-delivery.md.
#
# Idempotent and interrupt-safe by construction, not by special-casing:
# - a `.engine-cache-key` marker (this fingerprint, written only after a full
#   sync) makes a second run skip the network entirely when nothing changed --
#   a stale or missing marker just means "try the network again", never a
#   reason to refuse. The marker is believed only while every file the sync
#   put in place is still there (`.engine-cache-files` lists them): a marker
#   beside a deleted engine would otherwise skip the download and pay for a
#   full local build instead.
# - the archive is extracted into a staging directory UNDER `${DATA}` (so `mv`
#   is same-filesystem and atomic), then moved into place file by file, and
#   the marker is written only once every move has succeeded. A kill at any
#   point leaves either the old file or the fully-moved new one at each final
#   path -- never a truncated one -- and never writes a marker for a sync that
#   did not finish, so the next run just tries again rather than trusting a
#   half-applied cache. `build-engines` at the end tolerates a partial mix of
#   old/new/missing engines the same way it always has.
# - the download itself RESUMES. A ~50 MB asset over a conference wifi is a
#   minute of exposure, and starting again from zero after each interruption
#   is how a step that is retried three times still never finishes. The partial
#   file is kept in `.engine-download/` deliberately -- it is the resume point,
#   not litter -- and removed once the sync has succeeded. A resumed file that
#   fails its checksum is re-fetched whole once before being given up on,
#   because that is what a resume onto a changed asset looks like.
# - the manifest is fetched with cache-busting. GitHub's release CDN served a
#   manifest.json 30 seconds stale immediately after an upload during this
#   work; believing it costs a ~9 minute local build for an asset that is
#   sitting on the release.
