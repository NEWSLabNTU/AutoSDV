# What AutoSDV costs a host machine, measured

The figures behind the book's "What Machine You Need" page. They live here
rather than there because a student choosing a laptop needs one table and a
yes/no about the GPU; the methodology, the per-workload breakdown and the
reasons a number is what it is are ours to maintain, not theirs to read.

**Measured on**: Ubuntu 22.04, Intel Core Ultra 7 270K Plus (24 cores), 125 GB
RAM, RTX 5090, with `scripts/profiling/host_resource_sampler.py`. Memory is the
machine's own usage over an idle baseline, which is what a smaller machine has
to find. CPU is in whole cores, the figure that transfers to a machine with a
different core count.

## Per workload

| Workload | Peak RAM | CPU at startup | CPU in steady state |
|---|---|---|---|
| `just build`, clean workspace | **11.3 GiB** | every core available | — |
| Planning simulation | **2.5 GiB** | 19 cores, briefly | ~2 cores |
| Logging simulation, CPU path | **3.4 GiB** | 21 cores, briefly | ~3 cores |
| Logging simulation, GPU path | 3.4 GiB + ~1 GiB VRAM | same | ~3 cores |
| RViz, added to any of them | ~1.4 GiB | — | ~1 core |

**The build peak is the largest, and it is adjustable.** 11.3 GiB is colcon
compiling 31 packages with 24 jobs in parallel; the trace spends about twelve
seconds there and then falls away. The peak scales with how many compilers run
at once, so a 4-core laptop reaches roughly a quarter of it without being asked.
On a memory-short machine, cap it rather than discovering the OOM killer:

```bash
colcon build --base-paths src --symlink-install \
  --cmake-args -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release --parallel-workers 2
```

**"CPU at startup" is a burst, not a requirement.** Launching a stack starts
thirty-odd nodes at once and they use every core present -- 21 of 24 here. On
four cores the same work takes longer and nothing fails. What a machine must
sustain is the steady-state column: two to three cores.

**The build is quick because most of Autoware is already built.** 31 packages in
**89 seconds** here. AutoSDV is a workspace *over* a binary Autoware install, so
`just build` compiles the vehicle's own packages and not the 30 GB underneath.
Minutes, not hours -- and on four cores, still minutes.

## Disk

| | |
|---|---|
| Autoware Debian, downloaded | 1.9 GB |
| Autoware, installed at `/opt/autoware/1.5.0` | 4.8 GB |
| This repository, cloned (includes the COSS map) | ~1 GB |
| Workspace after `just build` (`build/` + `install/`) | 0.9 GB |
| COSS rosbag, downloaded | 1.6 GB |
| COSS rosbag, unpacked | 2.8 GB |
| **Total, everything, after cleanup** | **~11 GB** |

20 GB free is the floor because the rosbag's download and its unpacked copy
coexist for a while, and because `play_log/` grows with every run. 40 GB to
record your own bags, the one item here with no natural size.

## The GPU

Neither simulation requires one.

- The planning simulation has no sensors, no perception and no localization. It
  never touches a GPU.
- The logging simulation with `pose_source:=ndt launch_perception:=false` is
  pure CPU and holds the sensor's full rate -- measured 10.06 Hz against a 10 Hz
  recording.

What a GPU buys: `pose_source:=cuda_ndt` (~1 GiB VRAM) and perception's TensorRT
models (VRAM, plus the engine build -- see
`docs/roadmap/11-engine-file-delivery.md`).

**RViz wants a real graphics stack.** Over a plain VNC server with software
rendering it drew **1 fps** on this machine: enough to confirm something is on
screen, useless for watching a vehicle drive.

## Re-measuring

```bash
scripts/profiling/host_resource_sampler.py -o tmp/host.csv
```

`scripts/profiling/README.md` says what each column means. Re-run after an
Autoware upgrade or a change to what `just build` compiles; the numbers above
are one machine on one day, not a contract.
