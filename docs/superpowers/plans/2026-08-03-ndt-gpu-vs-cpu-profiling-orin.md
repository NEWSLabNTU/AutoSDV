**Goal:** answer whether `cuda_ndt_matcher`'s GPU pipeline is worth its
complexity on Orin, against two baselines — the same Rust algorithm on CPU, and
Autoware's OpenMP `autoware_ndt_scan_matcher` — with numbers that survive
scrutiny.

**Owner repos, all pushable, ff-merge to main:**
`NEWSLabNTU/AutoSDV` (develop), `NEWSLabNTU/cuda_ndt_matcher` (main),
`NEWSLabNTU/autoware_core` on branch `cuda_ndt` (the patched Autoware NDT, a
submodule at `src/localization/cuda_ndt_matcher/tests/comparison/autoware_core`).

## Read first

- `docs/guides/ndt-tuning.md` — the pitfalls. Non-optional: three of them were
  discovered the expensive way and two of them invert the answer if ignored.
- `docs/reports/cuda-ndt-coss-replay.md` — why the stack is configured as it is,
  and the contended-GPU episode that this phase must not repeat.
- `demo/README.md` §Benchmarking — how to drive the harness.

## What already exists

```bash
just demo bench                       # gpu, cpu, autoware; ~15 min
just demo bench "gpu cpu" 3           # subset, three repeats
just demo bench-report <bench_dir>/runs.tsv
```

| piece | where |
|---|---|
| matrix driver | `demo/scripts/run-ndt-benchmark.sh` |
| single run, parameterised | `demo/scripts/run-coss-ndt.sh` (`POSE_SOURCE`, `NDT_USE_GPU`, `NDT_DEBUG_FILE`) |
| report | `scripts/testing/localization/ndt_benchmark_report.py` |

Configurations: `gpu` = as shipped; `cpu` = `NDT_USE_GPU=0`, which is meant to be
the same Rust algorithm without the GPU; `autoware` = `pose_source:=ndt`.

The report deliberately covers three axes, because speed alone misleads:
**speed** (exe_time, and what fraction blew the 100 ms scan budget), **cost**
(CPU/GPU/RSS from the samples `play_launch` already takes), and **equivalence**
(iterations and NVTL — if the configurations did not converge alike, the timing
comparison is void and the report says so).

Logging is **off by default**: the always-published diagnostics carry exe_time,
iterations and scores per scan, so a benchmark costs nothing extra. `PROFILE=1`
additionally requests per-iteration JSONL, which needs a matcher built with
`just build-cuda-debug-iterations` inside the cuda_ndt_matcher submodule.

## Blocker found on the desktop: `NDT_USE_GPU=0` is not the same algorithm

First full matrix, desktop, **GPU contended by an unrelated process at 85 %**:

| config | aligns | mean ms | p95 | >budget | cpu % | iters | NVTL | poses |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| gpu | 1252 | 13.07 | 23.23 | 0.0 % | 49.8 | 2.40 | 2.792 | 1246 |
| cpu | 1128 | 69.78 | 173.88 | 22.6 % | 93.1 | **13.03** | **1.979** | **0** |
| autoware | 1381 | 4.62 | 7.89 | 0.0 % | 48.7 | 4.31 | 4.594 | 1376 |

The equivalence check fired: **13.03 iterations against 2.40, NVTL 1.979 against
2.792, and zero poses published** because every frame failed the 2.3 convergence
gate. The CPU path is not the GPU path running slower — it converges differently
and worse. So "the GPU is 5.3x faster" is **not a supportable claim** from this
data, and the headline question cannot be answered until this is resolved.

**Task 1, and everything else is blocked behind it:** find out whether the CPU
path is a genuinely different implementation (different derivatives, no line
search, a different termination rule) or simply broken. Start at
`ndt_cuda/src/ndt.rs:298` (`gpu_runtime` is only constructed when
`use_gpu && is_cuda_available()`) and the two branches at `ndt.rs:429` and
`ndt.rs:548`; compare what each arm calls. `multi_grid.rs:584,603,627` run the
CPU arm under unit test, so it is exercised, but evidently not to parity.

Three outcomes, all acceptable, but say which one it is:
1. a bug in the CPU arm — fix it, then the comparison is honest;
2. an intentionally reduced CPU fallback — then the fair CPU baseline is
   `autoware`, not `NDT_USE_GPU=0`, and the report's `cpu` row should be
   relabelled so nobody quotes it;
3. a parameter mismatch (e.g. the CPU arm ignoring `use_line_search`) — align it.

Note also that `autoware` at 4.62 ms beat the contended `gpu` at 13.07 ms. On an
idle desktop GPU the same `gpu` configuration runs at **2.6 ms parked, 4.1 ms
driving**, so that ordering is probably contention, not a real result — but it is
unverified, and re-establishing it on an idle machine is Task 2.

## Orin specifics

- **Thermals and clocks decide the answer.** Fix them before measuring and record
  what was set: `sudo nvpmodel -q`, `sudo jetson_clocks --show`. A benchmark at
  an unpinned clock measures the governor. Run the matrix at least twice and
  check the second is not systematically slower (thermal drift).
- **Unified memory.** Orin's GPU and CPU share physical memory, so the
  host/device copies that dominate discrete-GPU overhead behave differently. A
  GPU win on the 5090 does not transfer, in either direction.
- **`cudarc` must stay on the `cuda-12050` feature** even though JetPack ships
  CUDA 12.6: Tegra's driver lacks `cuEventElapsedTime_v2` and `cusolverDnXgeev`,
  and a higher feature panics on the missing symbol. See the submodule's
  CLAUDE.md.
- **`CUDA_ARCH=87`** for Orin.
- **Sampling.** `tegrastats` gives GPU, CPU-per-core and power;
  `scripts/analyze_tegrastats_cpu.py` and `analyze_resource_usage.py` in the
  submodule already parse it. `play_launch`'s per-node `metrics.csv` also carries
  `gpu_utilization_percent` and `gpu_power_milliwatts`, and the harness copies
  the matcher's into each run directory.
- **Power is a first-class metric here**, unlike on the desktop. The submodule's
  earlier figures claim 34.8 Hz vs Autoware's 26.5 Hz and 57 % less NDT CPU at
  equal power on Orin — worth confirming or retiring, since they predate every
  fix from the July investigation.

## Data and build on the Orin

```bash
just demo check                 # prerequisites
just demo prepare               # fetches the 2.8 GB bag, builds
```

`just build` is required, not plain colcon: it passes `--cargo-args --release`,
without which the matcher is a debug binary about 8x slower — the single easiest
way to produce a meaningless benchmark. `just demo check` warns if the installed
binary looks like a debug build.

## Method

1. Resolve the CPU-path question (Task 1). Until then, report `gpu` against
   `autoware` only.
2. Fix clocks and power mode; record them in the report.
3. `just demo bench "gpu cpu autoware" 3`. Confirm no other process is on the GPU
   first — `nvidia-smi --query-compute-apps=...`, or `tegrastats` on Orin.
4. Check the equivalence line before reading any timing. If it says the
   configurations did different work, the timings are not comparable; fix that
   first.
5. Compare against the desktop numbers above, and against the submodule's
   `docs/performance/autoware-comparison.md`.

## Acceptance

A result is finished when it states, with numbers:

- GPU against CPU **at matched convergence** (equal iterations and score to
  within the report's tolerance), or an explicit statement that the CPU path
  cannot serve as a baseline and why;
- GPU against Autoware OpenMP, on exe_time, on the fraction of scans that blew
  the budget, and on published poses;
- CPU cost and power for each, since on Orin the point of offloading is to free
  CPU for perception rather than to win milliseconds;
- the clock and power mode the numbers were taken at, and evidence the GPU was
  otherwise idle;
- a verdict on whether the CUDA path is worth its maintenance on this platform.

Write it to `docs/reports/ndt-gpu-vs-cpu-orin.md`, and update the submodule's
`docs/performance/autoware-comparison.md` if the old figures no longer hold.

## Traps that already cost time here

- **NVTL is a convergence gate, not a quality score.** It scales with
  `ndt.resolution` and rises when far returns are excluded. Tuning to maximise it
  selects coarse voxels and narrow crops regardless of accuracy — it inverted the
  conclusion twice in July.
- **A shared GPU makes every timing meaningless**, and the tell is that only wall
  clock moves while iterations and NVTL stay put.
- **`ros2 node list` is not a readiness signal** at this stack size; it reported
  24 of 127 nodes on a healthy system. The harness waits on the matcher's own log
  line instead.
- **A matcher that misses the scan budget looks fast**: it drops scans. Always
  read the alignment and pose counts next to the mean.

## Out of scope

The vehicle-side items in `docs/reports/localization-open-questions.md` — wheel
speed scale, extrinsics, steering feedback — are unrelated to this phase and
should not be pulled in.
