"""What a setup step is, and what the machine looks like.

The old design split this knowledge three ways: a `MENU_ITEMS` array in
`setup.sh` held the labels and defaults, the `setup:` recipe in the justfile held
the order, and a `_setup-*` wrapper per option held the condition. Steps that
nobody wrote a wrapper for ran unconditionally and never appeared in the menu --
thirteen of them, including two that write udev rules.

Here a step is one object. If it is not in this list it does not run, and if it
is in this list the UI shows it.
