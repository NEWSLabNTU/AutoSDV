# Source the environment every AutoSDV command needs, in the one order that
# works. Not executable: `source scripts/env.sh` from a bash shell.
#
# Why this file exists
# --------------------
# Two layers have to be present and `install/setup.bash` does not chain to the
# one underneath it, so a shell with only ROS and the workspace cannot see the
# Autoware packages AutoSDV is built against -- and, because Autoware's
# setup.bash is also what selects the middleware, cannot see a running stack
# either. Nodes start cleanly, report themselves ready, and publish into a void.
# There is no error message for that; topics are simply empty. It is defect 5 in
# docs/known-config-defects.md.
#
# Order matters: Autoware first, workspace last, so the workspace's overlay
# wins for packages it rebuilds.
#
# What this file deliberately does NOT do
# ---------------------------------------
# It sets no middleware of its own. Which RMW to run is the user's choice --
# CycloneDDS, Zenoh, something else -- and it belongs in `.envrc`, not in a
# helper every recipe sources. The one thing done here is to keep a choice the
# user has already made: Autoware's setup.bash exports
# RMW_IMPLEMENTATION=rmw_cyclonedds_cpp unconditionally, so an explicit
# selection has to be restored after it runs or it is silently overwritten.
